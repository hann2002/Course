# Introduction to Computer

## Project 1 - Boolean Logic
Build all the logic gates, yielding a basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.

## Project 2 - Boolean Arithmetic
Build all the chips leading up to an Arithmetic Logic Unit - the Hack computer's ALU. The only building blocks that you can use are the chips described in chapter 1 and the chips that you will gradually build in this project.

## Project 3 - Memory
Build all the chips leading up to a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit. The only building blocks that you can use are primitive DFF gates, chips that you will build on top of them, and chips described in previous chapters.

## Project 4 - Machine Language Programming
Write and test the two programs described bellow and executed on the supplied CPU emulator.
### Mult.asm - Multiplication
Computes the value R0*R1 and stores the result in R2.
### Fill.asm - I/O handling
Illustrates low-level handling of the screen and keyboard devices. 

## Project 5 - Computer Architecture
Complete the construction of the Hack CPU and the Hack hardware platform, leading up to the top-most Computer chip.  

## Final Project - Implement The Operating System in Jack
Implement the operating system in Jack.  
Including: 
- Array
- Math
- Memory
- Keyboard
- Output
- String
- Screen
