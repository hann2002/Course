## HW1 Regression
COVID-19 daily cases prediction

Given survey results in the past 3 days in a specific state in U.S., then 
predict the percentage of new tested positive cases in the 3rd day. 

## HW2 Multiclass Classification
Framewise phoneme prediction from speech.
 - Solve a classification problem with deep neural networks (DNNs).
 - Understand recursive neural networks (RNNs)

## HW3 CNN - Image Classification
Solve image classification with convolutional neural networks(CNN).

## HW4 Self-attention - Speaker Identification
Predict speaker class from given speech.

## HW5 Transformer - Machine Translation
Translate English to Traditional Chinese

Since sentences are with different length in different languages, the seq2seq 
framework is applied to this task.

## HW6 Generative Model - Diffusion Model
Anime face generation
 - Input: random number
 - Output: Anime face

## HW7 BERT - Question Answering
Traditional Chinese reading comprehension extractive question answering

## HW8 Auto-encoder - Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
Training a model to determine whether the given image is similar with the training data.

## HW9 Explainable AI
Run the code and finish questions.
### Topic I - CNN (hw3)
 - Lime package
 - Saliency map
 - Smooth Grad
 - Filter Visualization
 - Integrated Gradients

### Topic II - BERT explanation (hw7)
 - Attention Visualization
 - Embedding Visualization
 - Embedding analysis

## HW10 Adversarial Attack
Train a proxy network and use the proxy network to generate attacked objects

## HW11 Adaptation - Domain Adaptation
Given real **images** (with labels) and **drawing images** (without labels), use domain adaptation technique to make your network predict the drawing images correctly.

## HW12 Reinforcement Learning
Implement some Deep Reinforcement Learning methods:
 - Policy Gradient
 - Actor-Critic

## HW13 Network Compression
Train a very small model to complete 
HW3 (image classification on the food dataset)

## HW14 Regularization-based Life-long Learning
Run the code and finish questions.

## HW15 Meta Learning - Few-shot Classification
Training MAML on Omniglot classification task.
